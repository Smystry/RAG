      "3.  **Is there a late registration policy or deadline?** Some courses have a strict drop/add period after which you simply can't join.\n",
      "4.  **How can you catch up on the missed material?** Are recordings of lectures available? Can you get notes from classmates? Are there supplementary readings or resources?\n",
      "5.  **Have any graded assignments or exams already taken place?** If so, can they be made up, or will you just have to take a zero?\n",
      "6.  **Is the course cumulative, or are modules relatively independent?** It's often easier to jump into a course where each week is a separate topic, rather than one that builds heavily on prior knowledge.\n",
      "7.  **What are the fees for late enrollment, if any?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, consider your own capacity: are you willing and able to put in the extra effort to catch up quickly without getting overwhelmed?\n",

      "    *   **For professional development, workshops, or online courses:** Reach out to the course coordinator, admissions, or the support team.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Be Prepared to Catch Up:**\n",
      "    *   **How much content have you missed?** A day or two is usually manageable. A week or more might require significant effort.\n",
      "    *   **Are there missed assignments or quizzes?** Ask if you can make them up, if they'll be dropped, or how they will affect your overall grade/progress.\n",
      "    *   **Is the course cumulative?** If it builds heavily on early concepts (like math or programming), catching up will be harder but not impossible with dedication.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Consider the Type of Course:**\n",
      "    *   **Self-paced online courses:** Often have rolling admissions, so joining late is usually fine.\n",
      "    *   **Live online or in-person courses:** More structured, but still often allow latecomers within a certain window. You might need to watch recordings or get notes from peers.\n",
      "    *   **Intensive workshops (e.g., a 2-day workshop):** If you've missed a significant portion of a short, intensive course, it might be too late to join meaningfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Ask About Deadlines and Policies:**\n",
      "    *   Is there a strict enrollment deadline that has passed?\n",
      "    *   Are there any penalties for late enrollment?\n",
      "    *   Will the fee be pro-rated, or will you pay the full amount?\n",
      "\n",

       "'This error, \"invalid reference format: repository name must be lowercase,\" often arises when mapping volumes with Docker, especially on Windows. The way it\\'s shown in course videos may not work for all setups.\\n\\nHere are several solutions and tips from the FAQ:\\n\\n**General Recommendations (especially for Windows):**\\n\\n1.  **Remove spaces from your path:** If your code is in a folder like \"C:/Users/Alexey Grigorev/git/…\", try moving it to a simpler path like \"C:/git/…\".\\n\\n**Specific Solutions for Windows Volume Mounting:**\\n\\nTry replacing the `-v` part of your Docker command with one of these options:\\n\\n*   `-v /c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`\\n*   `-v //c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`\\n*   `-v /c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`\\n*   `-v //c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`\\n*   `--volume //driveletter/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data/:/var/lib/postgresql/data`\\n\\nYou can also try adding quotes around the path:\\n\\n*   `-v \"/c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"`\\n*   `-v \"//c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"`\\n*   `-v “/c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"`\\n*   `-v \"//c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"`\\n*   `-v \"c:\\\\some\\\\path\\\\ny_taxi_postgres_data\":/var/lib/postgresql/data`\\n\\n**Using `winpty` (Windows):**\\n\\n*   Try adding `winpty` before the entire Docker command. For example:\\n    ```\\n    winpty docker run -it \\\\\\n    -e POSTGRES_USER=\"root\" \\\\\\n    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=\"root\" \\\\\\n    -e POSTGRES_DB=\"ny_taxi\" \\\\\\n    -v /c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \\\\\\n    -p 5432:5432 \\\\\\n    postgres:1\\n    ```\\n\\n**Using `$(pwd)` (Windows & Mac):**\\n\\n*   **For Windows:**\\n    ```\\n    -v /”$(pwd)”/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\\n    ```\\n    *Important: Note how the quotes are placed.*\\n\\n*   **For Mac:** You can wrap `$(pwd)` with quotes:\\n    ```\\n    docker run -it \\\\\\n    -e POSTGRES_USER=\"root\" \\\\\\n    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=\"root\" \\\\\\n    -e POSTGRES_DB=\"ny_taxi\" \\\\\\n    -v \"$(pwd)\"/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \\\\\\n    -p 5432:5432 \\\\\\n    postgres:13\\n    ```\\n\\n**If path-based volume options don\\'t work:**\\n\\n*   You can use a **volume name** instead of a local path:\\n    ```\\n    -v ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\\n    ```\\n\\n**Note for Windows:**\\nIf Docker automatically creates a folder called “ny_taxi_postgres_data;C”, it suggests you have problems with volume mapping. Try deleting both folders and trying other `-v` options. For some users, `//c/` works instead of `/c/`.'"

       "\"It sounds like you're encountering an `OperationalError` where password authentication is failing for your Postgres user on port 5432.\\n\\nHere's what the FAQ suggests:\\n\\n1.  **Port Conflict:** The port 5432 might be taken by another Postgres instance running on your machine. When connecting from a Jupyter notebook (e.g., using `engine = create_engine('postgresql://root:root@localhost:5432/ny_taxi')`), you're trying to connect to a port on your local machine, not directly to the Docker container's internal port.\\n    *   **Solution:** Check which port you mapped for your Postgres Docker container. If you mapped it to a different port (e.g., 5431), use that port in your connection string instead of 5432.\\n\\n2.  **Persistent Issue (Windows specific):** If the error persists, especially if you're on Windows, check if you have a Postgres service running in the background.\\n    *   **Solution:** Stopping this Windows service should resolve the issue.\""
